## Planning

### User Stories

> Important!

Use google docs and write out stories that describe the roles, goals and benefits. `As a _____, I want to _____, Because _____.`

A user scenario describes a context, the action taken, and the result. `Given _____, When _____, Then _____.`

[Read this article about User Stories](https://medium.com/@jonatisokon/a-framework-for-user-stories-bc3dc323eca9), it only takes a few minutes and it is a good process for thinking about user stories.

### Features

Decide what your competative advantage is. Focus on that.

All of the features that you need to prove your method works need to be there. This is an MVP, minimum viable product. Wouldn't it be cool if we focused on the most important things.

You don't need to prove you can make a login flow. We've done that already. You would never do this in production, but for development you can setup a route to log you in as any user.

```javascript
app.get("/login/:id", (request, response) => {
  request.session.user_id = request.params.id;
  resonse.redirect("/");
});
```

### ERD

> Important!

https://www.draw.io/

Where are the relationships? Get this reviewed by a mentor.

Tables are nouns, they can be taken right from User Stories.

Follow conventions:

- Table names are plural
- Primary key is `id`
- Foreign key is `<table>_id`

### Wireframe

You need to define where the data that you have chosen to collect is going to go on the page you can display. Be thorough in sketching a wireframe for every page you plan to build, but don't spend more than a couple of minutes creating a VERY low-res version of that page.

### Routes

Follow conventions:

- Browse/List/Index: GET /photos
- Create/Add: POST /photos
- Read/Show: GET /photos/:id
- Update/Edit: PUT /photos/:id
- Remove/Destroy: DELETE /photos/:id

### Design

Design is important. Allow it to highlight your strengths but don't focus on it.

Fonts

Use only one or two fonts.

- [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)

Colours

With the tools available it is easy to choose colours that go well together.

## Git

Use good git practices. Please.

0. Clone - get your own local version to work on | and lint
1. Branch - DO NOT CODE ON MASTER | and lint
1. Code & Test - on your feature branch until it works and has no discernible deficiencies | and lint
1. Checkout master - this should not have changed; this should have not changed | and lint
1. Pull & Test - pull will get all of the merged features from your collaborators | and lint
   so make sure that it run on your machine | and lint
1. Merge & Test - merge from your feature branch into your local master and then | and lint
   make sure that your feature works when merged with all the other new stuff, right? | and lint
1. Push - send your commits from your local master to the remote master | and lint
1. Go to step 1 | and lint

Here are a few things to remember:

- master should always be sane - in other works, it should always contain runnable code
- Use feature branching
  - A very good tutorial: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow
  - Git cheatsheet: http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html
- Use database migrations and seeds
  - Remember: each developer will have their own copy of the database, so migrations will be used to keep the schema in sync, while seeds will provide initial data (e.g admin users)

## Project Setup

Do this together.

1. create exactly one GitHub repository
2. add all your team members as collaborators
3. one person clone the skeleton
4. change the remote to the new repo
5. push to the new repo
6. everybody else clone the new repo
7. do the "getting started" section of the readme on one person's computer, as well as
   - actually do what the readme says instead of doing something else...please
     - COPY the `.env.example` file, do not rename it
   - the `.env.example` file has a very confusing line in it that breaks things
     - the line that says `DB_SSL=true if heroku` is NUTS - delete it
   - in `package.json` delete the dev dependency on sqlite3 because you're
     not using and it causes installation issues
   - run `npm outdated` to see what the latest versions of your dependencies are
     - you _may_ update the versions in your `package.json` file
   - do the above before `npm i`
   - before running the migrations, double check that the info in `.env` is 100%
     correct
     - if the named database doesn't exist, create it
   - read all the code in all the files in the skeleton together and make sure
     everyone knows what they are all for
   - Make sure your app loads, check for console output

## Dividing Tasks

There is no perfect way to do this. You need to figure this out within your team. Here are some options.

Vertical

- Break the project out into features
- Prioritize the features
- Each developer would build a feature full stack

Horizontal

- Break the project down into technical domains
- One or more developers will be responsible for an entire domain
- Domains could be ui, api (routes), db

**Communication is critical no matter which way you divide the tasks.**

## Communication

EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM IS DOING AT ALL TIMES.

1. find your group
2. exchange contact info (phone numbers, email addresses)
3. create a private Slack group
4. install the Slack app on your phone and enable notifications

### Browser

Start with a static page.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="description" content="<fill this in>">
    <meta name="author" content="<fill this in>">

    <style>
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can put all of the structure and styles for a page into page.html. Once you feel comfortable, make these into templates. Only start coding the EJS or jQuery JavaScript portion after the style and structure is solid.

Use the static structure to understand how to break your layout into reusable pieces. This will help you break your client code into functions or your template code into partials.

Decide on css naming as a team.

User placeholders for text and images.

- http://placekitten.com
- http://meettheipsums.com

Make sure to test your layouts with a lot of data, and don't alway use 'good' data.

### Node

Setup your database schema by creating one or more migrations. Setup some good test data in your seeds. Review your user stories and use the CLI make sure you can make the queries to satisfy them.

Once you are confident your queries work create the interface to the data you are retrieving from the database. The interface is usually the `Routes` that you design. Build this in small atomic steps. Use module exports and break your code up.

Let's say my user story is `As a user, I can view all of the photos of another user, because I want to see what they are about to eat for dinner.`. We need to figure out how to store this data necessary for this.

I need a photos table and a users table. Photos will belong to users. I've decided to store a link to a photo as a url. This way I can easily use placeholder images. Later on when I add the ability for a user to upload a photo I can update the database with a link to the uploaded photo.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  password varchar(32) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE photos (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  url varchar(255),
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('first@user.com', '123456');
INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('second@user.com', '123456');

INSERT INTO photos (url, user_id) VALUES('http://www.fillmurray.com/g/200/300', 1);
INSERT INTO photos (url, user_id) VALUES('http://www.fillmurray.com/g/200/300', 1);
INSERT INTO photos (url, user_id) VALUES('http://www.fillmurray.com/g/200/300', 1);
INSERT INTO photos (url, user_id) VALUES('http://www.fillmurray.com/g/200/300', 2);
INSERT INTO photos (url, user_id) VALUES('http://www.fillmurray.com/g/200/300', 2);
INSERT INTO photos (url, user_id) VALUES('http://www.fillmurray.com/g/200/300', 2);
```

The route that I would use to view this would be `/users/:id/photos`. For the purposes of testing I would make this route return JSON, with the intention of having it render a template in the future.

```javascript
app.get("/users/:id/photos", (request, response) => {
  knex("photos")
    .where("user_id", request.params.id)
    .then(photos => {
      response.json(photos);
    });
});
```

In the case that I want to create a single page app, or even just query data from an api then this JSON response would be enough.

### Deployment

http://localhost:3000 <-- that's all.
